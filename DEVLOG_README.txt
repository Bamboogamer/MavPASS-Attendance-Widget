Hiya! This program was written by me, Danny Le, in 2020 and going into 2021. This was just a little project that turned
into a much bigger project than I expected! Anyways, this is 100% written by me, at least as of writing this README
file. This is notes for future devs and myself to understand what each "class" is for.

CreateMasterCSV - Does what it says, generates a master CSV file from inputted EXCEL Attendance data.

DBConnect - IGNORE THIS, I wrote this just to test SQL coding a little bit with mySQL. Doesn't work with code at all.

ProgramData - Most, if not, all data that is needed to run the main program.
** Note: You can add new class codes in the code_by_department() function. Just add to its specific String[] array **

SessionObject/Student Objects - Used to collect data and used all throughout the program.

valid_email.csv file - CURRENT SEMESTER's 'VALID EMAILS', MUST BE UPDATED EVERY SEMESTER

I'll continue to add to this DevLog and date it as I go.
