Hiya! I'm Danny Le. I wrote this program entirely by myself as a side project for my MavPASS responsibilities. It turned
into a project that MavPASS staff picked up and eventually became "offical" and used by the MavPASS department. Written
entirely by me as of writing this README. This will be "open-source" for the MavPASS department of Minnesota State
University - Mankato. You are free to use as you will.

CLASSES / FILES:
  CreateMasterCSV - Does what it says, generates a master CSV file from inputted EXCEL Attendance data.

  DBConnect - IGNORE THIS, I wrote this just to test SQL coding a little bit with mySQL. Doesn't work with code at all.

  ProgramData - Most, if not, all data that is needed to run the main program.
  ** Note: You can add new class codes in the code_by_department() function. Just add to its specific String[] array **

  SessionObject/Student Objects - Used to collect data and used all throughout the program.

  valid_email.csv file - CURRENT SEMESTER's 'VALID EMAILS', MUST BE UPDATED EVERY SEMESTER

I'll continue to add to this DevLog and date it as I go. Thanks for Reading! c:
